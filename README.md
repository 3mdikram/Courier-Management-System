# Courier-Management-System
 
The Courier Management System is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that helps a courier company or businesses manage their customers parcel details. 
The system stores all the branches or the company that can be also use when setting a destination where can recipient pickup their packages or parcels.

The system admin or staff user can store or adds a multiple items at the same time but these items will be stored in the database seperately because each packagre has a different reference number or different tracking number. For example, Client 1 has 3 boxes of package to be couriered in a same recipient, the system user can submit the parcel registration to the system at once but will be stored seperately so that the system will generate a different unique reference number in each item so that they can track easily each items.
